                            <p>Эта таблица содержит основную информацию о графических процессорах NVIDIA серии GeForce и видеокартах, построенных на официальных спецификациях NVIDIA. Below are links to the archived Windows XP/2000 driver download pages. Не секрет, что понять, насколько та или иная видеокарта быстрее и лучше - очень не просто. 
Personally, I haven't owned an Nvidia graphics card since 2008, I don't have anything against Nvidia, It was just that at my price range AMD always performed better for the price, if Nvidia performed better for the price I would get that, Pretty crazy to think that I didn't have an Nvidia GPU since. What is a Legacy GPU? Legacy GPUs are older-generation NVIDIA GPUs which are no longer supported in the regular NVIDIA Unified UNIX Graphics Driver. Instead, these GPUs will continue to be supported through special "Legacy GPU" drivers that will be updated periodically to add support I currently have a 3 year toshiba laptop that has a Geforce Go 7900GTX running on Windows XP 32bit. I've downloaded the 179.13 drivers from laptopvideo2go about 1 year ago and well. no other drivers that support my graphics card has come out since then! I'm having quite a few issues playing the latest games - as I feel that my graphics card is being seriously underused (For example, in starcraft 2 beta). Can someone please give me some advice on how or where I can get more updated versions. Download drivers for NVIDIA products including GeForce graphics cards, nForce motherboards, Quadro workstations, and more. Update your graphics card drivers today.  
These drivers are only compatible with Windows Vista RTM build 6000 and higher, and should not be used with other versions of Windows Vista. Includes the new NVIDIA Control Panel. So initially I was very impressed with Aurora liquid cooled desktop that I received. Cool lights, good scores on 3dmarks (7900), then today all of the sudden while playing rocket league it kept freezing on me. Did some research on the "ran out of video memory message" and was hoping it was a rocket league issue. just to be sure I tried 3dmarks and that's when things got bad. Had bad graphical artifacts, terribly everywhere. Another benchmarking program called heaven something (cool castle. WHQL-certified driver for GeForce FX 5-series, 6-series, 7-series, 8-series, and 9 series GPUs. Improved 3D performance and load times for GeForce 8 and 9 series GPUs in some DirectX 9 and OpenGL applications as a result an improved shader optimizer. I’m looking to spend around 00 on a new card. I’m looking at either the RTX 5000 or the Titan RTX. My mobo is an Asus X299 Deluxe with an Intel i9-7900 and 64GB of GSkill RAM. The machine will mostly be used for Revit and AutoCAD, but will also be used with VR enabled apps such as Enscape and Revit Live, as well as other visualization tools such as Lumion. I’ll also be running SketchUp, Rhino3D, 3D Studio Max, PhotoShop, InDesign, Premier Pro, as well as SteamVR. I also have a Vive Pro headse. This is the first WHQL-certified unified driver from the R300 family of drivers (versions 300.00 to 301.99). GeForce R300 drivers are packed with new industry-leading, GeForce-exclusive features as well as some really nice performance increases in top games. 
I recently got a "new" gpu (GeForce 7900 GS) because my good one broke, I was able to play some games like Starcraft II and CS:GO, which I thought would make the next few months bearable until I get a new one, Whenever I tried to tab out I would get a BSOD, the error says something close to "Nvlddmkm.sys" in a super low res when it happens. Yesterday after a blue screen I wasnt able to open ANY game without getting another one. I can watch videos perfectly fine etc. I tried rolling can be downloaded here at Guru3D.com download servers. Click on this link to obtain full file-details and download mirrors. Trying to return to the game after some pause Meanwhile changed my GFX card from Nvidia to ATI and Im geting the message "You apear to be using an outdated video driver" My graphic card is AMD Radeon R9 200 / HD 7900 series and my installed drivers are the latest ones. I tried to ignore the message but game its unplayable my fps going from 30 - 0 freezing avery few sec for 1-2 sec. Tried to play on DX 9 not helping. Any fix to this problem. PureVideo is Nvidia's hardware SIP core that performs video decoding.PureVideo is integrated into some of the Nvidia GPUs, and it supports hardware decoding of multiple video codec standards: MPEG-2, VC-1, H.264 This week my GTX 560 TI started failing, started getting artifacts right after windows log in and reboots shortly after. I tried cleaning it and reapplying thermal compound with no luck, and swapping PCI slots but it seems to be a lost cause. amp#x200B; In the meantime I tried tossing in my even older R6570 MDIG3 but the drivers wont even take. Whenever I try a reinstall window identifies it as a NVIDIA 7900 GS and installs those drivers. And I can't get the AMD catalyst to take. I assume. Here are the latest articles published on Tom’s Hardware. See the latest news, reviews and roundups and access our tech archives. I got to the point of wanting Xorg on my old laptop. I tried to follow the wiki but found myself uncertain of what to do. amp#x200B; First I identify my graphics card as "GeForce Go 7900 GTX" as follows: amp#x200B; \ root@lappy \~\ # lspci -k grep -A 2 -E "(VGA 3D)" 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation G71M \ GeForce Go 7900 GTX\ (rev a1) Subsystem: Toshiba America Info Systems G71M \ GeForce Go 7900 GTX\ Part 2: libgl providers Kernel driver in use: nouveau. Hello, amp#x200B; As the title suggests, i am having some problems with my AMD GPU. I am using a ThinkPad T430, which has an internal HD4000 GPU (and a disabled Nvidia NVS 5400M), and an externally connected (ExpressCard + EXP-GDC) HD7970. The GPU is detected fine and Drivers installed with no problem, and is displayed in Radeon Settings as "AMD Radeon R9 200 Series / HD 7900 Series (Discrete)". However, all of the games and testing tools seem to run on the HD4000 by default instead. So i have been having issues with GPU usage drops in this game since launch and i think i may have figured out why. For some reason this game uses up almost the entirety of my 8072mb frame buffer on my GTX 1080. According to other website's the average VRAM consumption on this game at 1440p is 3.5-4.5Gb. here's a post of the vram usage and my in game settings (https://imgur.com/a/Ti3KJYK) I have a feeling that if it gets this high it may have gotten as high as 7900 or above without me having. 
Payday 2 will briefly launch as a black window, then minimize immediately. The crashlog contains the following error: gt Application has crashed: C++ exception Failed setting up render device. gt Callstack: gt payday2_win32_release (???) ??? gt payday2_win32_release (???) ??? gt payday2_win32_release (???). Payday 2 will briefly launch as a black window, then minimize immediately. The crashlog contains the following error: Application has crashed: C++ exception Failed setting up render device. ------------------------------- Callstack: payday2_win32_release (???) ??? payday2_win32_release (???) ??? payday2_win32_release (???). Hey all, I'm pretty disappointed in what I've been able to get out of my card so far, hoping someone with more knowledge and understanding could help me out a bit - or at least tell me that there's nothing else I can do to squeeze performance out of the card. Quick rundown: EVGA 980 Ti SC+ on water, temps never go above 53 C. 69.6 ASIC On stock bios, I could only reach 1404 Mhz on the core. Memory did surprisingly well, totally solid at 7900, seemed fine at 8000. TL;DR - Downloaded Radeon Mod in an attempt to fix stuttering on NBA 2k16, clicked Restart Driver, now I can only duplicate screen across my two monitors (no extended display) and the resolution seems off, and NBA 2k is completely broken when I start it up. Full story - So I just got 2k16 a couple days ago. Played it for 3 days, including today. At first it had the problem of crashing occasionally but I think I fixed that based on just turning it to windowed fullscreen (which I should. I'm drawing many line segments with glDrawArrays(GL_LINE_STRIP,  ) in order to approximate a curve. If I set glLineWidth to a value larger than 1, I start to get these notches in the resulting lines ( They move with the camera and are not fixed to a specific point on the line, so I don't think it's due to a missing vertex or anything like that. Additionally, when viewing the lines from the side (so the line is nearly perpendicular to the camera) I get these. Since most of the threads for getting your card recognized are for Nvidia users I figured I'd write an easy one for people with AMD cards. I also did a video tutorial but I can't post here due to the rules. Step 1: Type Deviceconfig.log into the Windows 10 Search bar OR go to Documents gt Electronic Arts gt Sims 3 and find a txt document called deviceconfig. Step 2: After opening that go to the part that looks like this: === Graphics device info === Number: 0 Name (driver):. 
Album with crashed display: https://m.imgur.com/a/ye4yb My laptop display driver crashes repeatedly. I tried contacting Nvidia and was told it was not their driver but a memory issue. I then swapped out my memory from 1GB to 4 GB. When the driver was still crashing, I replaced my hard drive with a 256 SSD. After reading that the display crashing was a power issue I replaced the battery and I am still having display issues. My computer is old as bejeezus, I know this. However # A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment: # # EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION (0xc0000005) at pc=0x00007ffa69552177, pid=13728, tid=9752 # # JRE version: Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (8.0_25-b18) (build 1.8.0_25-b18) # Java VM: Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (25.25-b02 mixed mode windows-amd64 compressed oops) # Problematic frame: # C ig75icd64.dll+0x12177 # # Failed to write core dump. Minidumps are not enabled by default on client versions of Windows My friend gave me a graphics card, I tested it and it didn't really display, it showed the colours of the desktop background but blank. My friend told me its because the drivers on his computer weren't compatible(nvidia on his and its AMD). it turned on and fans worked, but is that a sign it doesn't work? The computer was windows 10 and the graphics card is Amd 7900 series. EDIT: There is a good chance that my results are not dx12 but dx11 even though it would be to the contrary of the review here: My Windows 10 Tech preview updated my drivers today to Ver. 15.200.1006.0 2/6/2015 so I decided to retest Star Swarm Stress Test. I will say with the update, it kinda broke CCC but its all good for now. below are the stats: GPU: AMD Radeon HD 7900 Series (r9 280x) CPU: Genui. I know you have ATI fanboys and nvidia fanboys, so I won't get into which is better as a gaming card. I think we can all agree that for gaming, ATI and nvidia have some high end and mid range cards in price ranges that compete pretty well with each other. So what's the technical 'guts' of the ATI architecture that makes it so much better at mining? I'm wondering if it's hardware, or if nvidia could come out with drivers to make their cards perform better? I also wonder if ATI/nvidia I feel the community really needs a resource like this. Because if I had a Doge for every-time taught a newbie how to Mine on Ubuntu, I would be a very rich doge! EDIT: Sorry if it looks funny, Reddit doesn't like the numbers I put in for some reason. If you have Ubuntu you have likely not upgraded because you think you cant mine on 13.10, and while that has been true in the past, a few people have got it figured out. So feel free to upgrade. If you are not on Ubuntu, Seriously you should. </p>
